                    In our website there are many different recipes for different types of courses.
                You can browse our collection and find your next dream meal.
                Recip-Easy was made so everyone can easily learn new recipes
                (possibly from scratch) and enjoy cooking more by expanding
                their cooking variety.
               </p>
                <p>
                The website was created by Gilad Chen and Malah Izraev on the
                29th of February, 2019. Beforehand, Malah had the great idea that
                is this website: using the simplicity of the internet to make cooking
                easier. Gilad then came up with the name. The two built Recip-Easy
                for 3 and a half years to make it what it is today.
                </p>
                <p>
                Before Recip-Easy Malah and Gilad worked
                together for NASA but decided it was not challenging enough
                so they then had the vision of making a recipe website.
