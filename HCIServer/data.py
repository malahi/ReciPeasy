            "description": '''  When my sister and I were thinking of soda fountain creations, our ideas revolved around iconic flavors and colors of the 1950s. After brainstorming the myriad of soda fountain treats, we couldn't think of a more fitting indulgence than the classic ice cream sundae. We settled on one of our favorite ice cream flavors, peppermint, which also happens to be a lovely shade of Cadillac pink- sure to win the Pink Ladies' approval''',
            "preperation": '''  Heat the milk, cream and peppermint candy in a large pot over medium heat, until the peppermints are dissolved, and the mixture is steamy.
                                Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks, sugar and salt in an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment for about five minutes (the yolks should be very thick, pale and glossy).
                                When the milk mixture is ready, add a small amount of it to the egg mixture, whisking all the while so as to not scramble the eggs. Add the rest of the liquid gradually as the mixer continues to run, creating a homogenous mixture.
                                Pour the mixture back into the pot, and cook slowly over medium heat--stirring constantly--until the mixture registers 170 degrees on a candy thermometer. Whatever you do, do not let the mixture boil.
                                As soon as the custard is ready, pour it through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl, in order to remove any coagulated egg bits.
                                Stir in the peppermint extract, and allow to cool. Chill until very cold, at least four hours.
                                Churn in an ice cream maker, according to manufacturer's instructions.
                                During the last minute of churning, gently fold in the broken cookie pieces.
                                Devilish Hot Fudge Sauce
                                Heat the butter and cream to a boil in a small saucepan.
                                Add the sugars and corn syrup, stirring constantly.
                                Add the cocoa and salt. Stir well.
                                Add the chocolate chips and mix until melted.
                                Off the heat, add the vanilla extract.
                                Sundae time! Also have ready: Freshly whipped cream (cream, a spot of confectioner's sugar and vanilla). Extra chocolate cookies, for garnish. Dark chocolate curls, for garnish. Peppermint sticks, for garnish. For assembly: Alternate scoops of ice cream with fudge sauce, and broken chocolate cookies. Crown with a cloud of whipped cream, drizzle with a few ribbons of fudge, and sprinkle with an abundance of chocolate curls. Complete the look by parking a swirly, twirly peppermint stick in the top. Now try not to inhale''',

            "preperation": '''  Have all the ingredients for this recipe prepared and ready to cook before beginning. Bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil and have it ready for the pasta.
                                Cut the asparagus into lengths about 2 inches long. If the stalks are thick, cut them in half or quarter them. Leave the tips in tact. Heat the butter in a large, deep skillet and add the asparagus pieces, salt, and pepper to taste. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until crisp-tender and lightly browned. Transfer the asparagus to a plate and reserve.
                                In the same pan, add the oil and garlic. Cook until lightly browned and remove and discard garlic. Add the tomatoes, parsley, basil, salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring, for about 10 minutes.
                                Meanwhile, add the pasta and salt to the water and, when it returns to a boil, cook for about 7 minutes or until tender. Do not overcook.
                                Just before the pasta is done, turn off the heat under the tomatoes and add the beaten eggs, stirring vigorously so that they blend without curdling. Do not boil the sauce after the eggs are added. (If you are nervous about curdling the eggs, you may temper them in, by stirring a ladleful of the hot tomato sauce into the eggs, then whisking the mixture back into the pan.)
                                Add the asparagus to the tomato sauce and stir to blend.

When I walked over to get them yesterday she asked me "are you ready for these?" and so - fair warning - they are an intense green. Strong and bitter, but I think balanced with some sweet and salt and richness they are absolutely delicious. - aargersi —aargersi''',
            "preperation": '''  Preheat the oven to 250° F (120° C).
                                Lightly grease three 8-inch round cake pans and line with parchment paper. Alternatively, line three baking sheets with parchment paper and draw an 8-inch circle on each one (you can use a cake pan as a guide to draw the circles).
                                In a clean metal or glass bowl, whisk the egg whites with the salt till they hold soft peaks. Whisk in the sugars 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vinegar and whisk until the mixture looks glossy and holds stiff peaks. Fold in the chopped nuts, gently but thoroughly.
                                Divide the meringue mixture equally between the 3 cake pans or 3 circles drawn on the baking sheets. Smooth the tops with the back of a round spoon. Bake until the tops are crisp and dry, an hour to 1 hour 15 mins. Switch off the oven and leave the pans in to cool for an hour with the door slightly ajar.
                                While the meringues cool, halve or quarter the strawberries depending on their size. Place in a large bowl, sprinkle sugar and rose water over the berries, toss gently and let stand for half an hour.
                                Beat cream and mascarpone with the rose water in a bowl until the mixture just holds stiff peaks.
                                Invert the cooled meringue discs onto a plate and gently peel off the parchment paper. Invert onto another plate so they are right side up.
                                Spread a third of the cream over one meringue disc, followed by a third of the strawberries. Repeat with the remaining meringue layers, cream and strawberries. Garnish with the slivered pistachios and serve.
                                Do-ahead: Although the dessert must be assembled just before serving, the meringue layers can be made ahead of time—they will keep well wrapped in parchment paper in an airtight container for up to a week.''',

            "description": '''  When my family and I lived in San Francisco, we often visited a little restaurant in the Mission District called Bissap Baobab. I particularly loved their hibiscus cocktails and a mustardy fish dish. Recently, I recalled the fish dish and tried to figure out what went into it. In my research, I came across a lot of references to a Senegalese dish made with variations of lemon, vinegar, and mustard. While it did not sound exactly like the Bissap Baobab fish, it sounded delicious enough for me to give it a try. I started building the recipe from some toasted coriander, black pepper, and chiles -- and the results were delicious, and very, very spicy. When I first tried a sample of a dried arbol chile, it was not so hot, but after a second little nibble, my lips lit on fire. I did find that cold cream cheese, applied as lipstick, does wonders for stopping the burn... and for my next attempt, I may choose to remove the seeds before adding the chiles to the dish to cut down on the heat. —savorthis''',

            "description": '''  This dessert is true frozen bliss. The recipe has been in my family for years. We compare all other desserts against it, and nothing, ever, has measured up. I make this all-year long, but it's especially great in the summer because it's quick and easy to assemble (no baking required) and feeds a crowd. —EmilyC''',
            "preperation": '''  For crust: Butter the bottom of a 9x13x2 pan (such as Pyrex). Melt 1/2 stick butter (4 tablespoons) in a bowl. Crush the Oreo cookies into fine crumbs with a little texture. (For ease, place the cookies in a zipper-lock bag, seal, and then crush with a rolling pin. Turn the bag inside-out to scrape out all of the crumbs.) Mix the Oreo crumbs with the melted butter in the pan, and press them evenly into the bottom. Cover the pan and freeze until the crust is set, about 30 minutes.
                                For filling: Let the ice cream soften a bit on the counter until it's spreadable. Evenly spread it over the Oreo crust. Cover the pan and return to the freezer for at least an hour to set the ice cream.
                                For fudge topping: Combine the remaining stick of butter (8 tablespoons), chocolate, sugar, and evaporated milk in a saucepan. Bring to a low boil and cook for 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Cool to room temperature. (If in a hurry, set the saucepan in a ice bath to speed up the cooling process, stirring several times and scraping down the sides of the bowl. It should be ready in 5 to 10 minutes.) Working quickly, pour the fudge evenly over the ice cream, covering as much as possible, then spread with a knife to distribute the fudge in a smooth, even layer. Cover the pan and return to the freezer for another hour or two, or until fully frozen and set.
                                When ready to serve, let the Oreo dessert sit on the counter for about 5 minutes to take the chill off (and make cutting easier), then cut into squares and serve. Tightly covered, it'll keep well in the freezer for several weeks.''',

            "name": '''Pistachio Meringue Stack with Rose Cream and Strawberries''',
            "description": '''  The classic combination of meringue and strawberries gets a new twist in this recipe. Pistachios and brown sugar add a depth of flavor to the meringue, rose water perfumes the whipped cream and mascarpone filling, and everything comes together to highlight the luscious taste of ripe strawberries. This recipe was originally inspired by Nigella Lawson's Gooey Chocolate Stack. Summer, and leftover ingredients from a recent tryst with kheer (Indian rice pudding) inspired this version. You can locate pistachios and rose water at any Indian or Middle-Eastern store; if not, I'm sure the combination of almonds and pure vanilla would be equally delightful. This delicious dessert also happens to be gluten-free. - Heena —Heena''',
            "preperation": '''  Preheat the oven to 250° F (120° C).
                                Lightly grease three 8-inch round cake pans and line with parchment paper. Alternatively, line three baking sheets with parchment paper and draw an 8-inch circle on each one (you can use a cake pan as a guide to draw the circles).
                                In a clean metal or glass bowl, whisk the egg whites with the salt till they hold soft peaks. Whisk in the sugars 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vinegar and whisk until the mixture looks glossy and holds stiff peaks. Fold in the chopped nuts, gently but thoroughly.
                                Divide the meringue mixture equally between the 3 cake pans or 3 circles drawn on the baking sheets. Smooth the tops with the back of a round spoon. Bake until the tops are crisp and dry, an hour to 1 hour 15 mins. Switch off the oven and leave the pans in to cool for an hour with the door slightly ajar.
                                While the meringues cool, halve or quarter the strawberries depending on their size. Place in a large bowl, sprinkle sugar and rose water over the berries, toss gently and let stand for half an hour.
                                Beat cream and mascarpone with the rose water in a bowl until the mixture just holds stiff peaks.
                                Invert the cooled meringue discs onto a plate and gently peel off the parchment paper. Invert onto another plate so they are right side up.
                                Spread a third of the cream over one meringue disc, followed by a third of the strawberries. Repeat with the remaining meringue layers, cream and strawberries. Garnish with the slivered pistachios and serve.
                                Do-ahead: Although the dessert must be assembled just before serving, the meringue layers can be made ahead of time—they will keep well wrapped in parchment paper in an airtight container for up to a week.''',

            "description": '''  When I was little, my mom would make us “l'uovo sbatutto,” which means “beaten egg,” with lots of sugar, to spoon into our coffee. Almost a deconstructed tiramisu, but with ice cream, this dessert is a combination of all my favorite sweet Italian things. Affogato means “drowned,” so maybe this is a drowned tiramisu. 
                                Feel free to break this recipe apart, and have your ice cream with just the espresso and liqueur (like a true affogato) or the espresso with a few dollops of the zabaglione—both equally good desserts on their own. —mrslarkin''',
