                Recip-Easy was made so everyone can easily learn new recipes

                The website was created by Gilad Chen and Malah Izraev on the
                29th of February, 2019. Beforehand, Malah had the great idea that
                is this website: using the simplicity of the internet to make cooking
                easier. Gilad then came up with the name. The two built Recip-Easy
                for 3 and a half years to make it what it is today.

                Before Recip-Easy Malah and Gilad worked
                together for NASA but decided it was not challenging enough
                so they then had the vision of making a recipe website.
